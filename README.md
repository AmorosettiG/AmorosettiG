### 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

- Hi, I’m Gabriel Amorosetti 👋

- I'm a **[Physics of Data](http://physicsofdata.dfa.unipd.it/)** Master's student at the University of Padua, Italy. 

  - Soon, I’ll be sharing here all my labs, assignments, and projects completed during the program !



### ⚛ Education & Research Experience

I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Physics** from the *University of Toulouse*, where I had the opportunity to work on several research projects :

- **Cold plasma data preprocessing** at the *LAPLACE* laboratory (Toulouse, France), under the supervision of Prof. Hubert Caquineau.  
- **Design and implementation of quantum algorithms** on a real quantum processor, as part of my **Bachelor’s thesis** supervised by Prof. Elisa Ercolessi (*University of Bologna*).  
- **Characterization of a deep learning approach for data recovery** in Soft X-Ray fusion plasma diagnostics for the RFX-mod experiment, during a post-bachelor internship supervised by Prof. Andrea Rigoni Garola at *Consorzio RFX*.

All the code related to these projects is available on my profile (and pinned just below) !



✨ *More coming soon — stay tuned !*
